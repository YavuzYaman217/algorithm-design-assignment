STRING MATCHING (BRUTE FORCE)

Problem:
Find pattern P in text T by checking all possible positions.

Algorithm:
1. Slide pattern over text from left to right
2. At each position, compare pattern with text substring
3. If all characters match, pattern found at that position
4. Continue until all positions checked

Steps:
- Outer loop: i from 0 to n-m (n=text length, m=pattern length)
- Inner loop: j from 0 to m-1
- Compare T[i+j] with P[j]
- If mismatch, break and try next position
- If all match, record position i

Complexity: O(n*m) time, O(1) space
Best case: O(n) - mismatch at first character
Worst case: O(n*m) - many partial matches
Common in: text editors, DNA sequence analysis
