SELECTION SORT

Problem:
Sort an array by repeatedly finding minimum element and placing it at beginning.

Algorithm:
1. Divide array into sorted (left) and unsorted (right) portions
2. Find minimum element in unsorted portion
3. Swap with first element of unsorted portion
4. Expand sorted portion by one
5. Repeat until entire array is sorted

Steps:
- Outer loop: i from 0 to n-2
- Set min = i
- Inner loop: j from i+1 to n-1
- Find index of minimum element in unsorted part
- Swap A[i] with A[min]

Complexity: O(n²) time, O(1) space
Always O(n²) - no best/worst case difference
Performs fewer swaps than bubble sort
