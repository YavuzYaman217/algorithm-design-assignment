BUBBLE SORT

Problem:
Sort an array in ascending order by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements.

Algorithm:
1. Iterate through array n times (outer loop)
2. In each pass, compare adjacent elements
3. Swap if left element > right element
4. After each pass, largest unsorted element "bubbles" to end
5. Reduce comparison range by i in each iteration

Steps:
- Outer loop: i from 0 to n-1
- Inner loop: j from 0 to n-i-2
- Compare A[j] and A[j+1]
- Swap if A[j] > A[j+1]

Complexity: O(n²) time, O(1) space
Best case: O(n) with optimization
Worst case: O(n²) - reversed array
