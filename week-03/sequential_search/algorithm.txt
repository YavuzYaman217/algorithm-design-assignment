SEQUENTIAL SEARCH (LINEAR SEARCH)

Problem:
Find the position of a target key in an array by checking each element sequentially.

Algorithm:
1. Start from first element of array
2. Compare each element with key
3. If match found, return index
4. If end reached without match, return -1 or None

Steps:
- Loop through array from index 0 to n-1
- Check if A[i] == key
- If yes, return i
- If loop completes, key not found

Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space
Best case: O(1) - key is first element
Worst case: O(n) - key is last or not present
Average case: O(n/2) = O(n)
