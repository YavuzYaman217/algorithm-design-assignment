Algorithm: Finding the Nearest Perfect Square
Step 1: Input
Take a positive integer N from the user.
Step 2: Calculate Square Root
Compute sqrt_N = √N.
Step 3: Find Boundary Squares
Determine the two perfect squares around N: lower = floor(sqrt_N)² and upper = ceiling(sqrt_N)².
Step 4: Determine Nearest Square
Calculate the midpoint: mid = (lower + upper) / 2. If N > mid, the nearest square is upper. Otherwise, the nearest square is lower.
