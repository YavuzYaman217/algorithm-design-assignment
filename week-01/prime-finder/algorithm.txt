Algorithm: Finding Prime Numbers up to N
Step 1: Setup
Take a positive integer N as the upper limit. Create an empty list prime_numbers.
Step 2: Check Each Number
For each number i from 2 to N: Calculate limit = âˆši (integer part). Check if i is divisible by any number j from 2 to limit: If i % j == 0, then i is not prime. Move to the next number. If no divisor is found, i is prime. Add it to prime_numbers.
Step 3: Result
The prime_numbers list contains all primes between 2 and N.
