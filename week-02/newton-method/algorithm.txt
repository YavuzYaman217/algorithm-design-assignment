Algorithm: Newton's Method for Finding Roots
Step 1: Input
Take function f(x), its derivative f'(x), initial guess x₀, and number of iterations n.
Step 2: Initialize
Set x = x₀ (initial guess).
Step 3: Iterate
For i from 1 to n: calculate x = x - f(x)/f'(x).
Step 4: Output
Return the approximated root after n iterations.
