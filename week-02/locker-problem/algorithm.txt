Algorithm: Locker Problem - Finding Open Lockers
Step 1: Input
Take the number of lockers N.
Step 2: Brute Force Simulation (Slow)
For each pass i from 1 to N, toggle every i-th locker. Return open lockers.
Step 3: Mathematical Optimization (Fast)
Only perfect squares remain open since they have odd number of divisors. Return all perfect squares â‰¤ N.
