Merge Sort Algorithm
=====================

Description:
Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the two sorted halves. It is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms and guarantees O(n log n) time complexity in all cases. The algorithm is stable and works well with large datasets.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases
Space Complexity: O(n)

Algorithm Steps:
1. Divide: Split the array into two halves at the middle point
2. Conquer: Recursively sort both halves
3. Combine: Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array

Merge Function:
1. Create temporary arrays L and R for left and right halves
2. Copy data to temporary arrays
3. Compare elements from L and R, placing smaller element in original array
4. Copy any remaining elements from L or R

Base Case: When array has 1 or 0 elements, it's already sorted

Example: [1, 3, 0, 7]
→ Split: [1, 3] and [0, 7]
→ Split again: [1], [3], [0], [7]
→ Merge: [1, 3] and [0, 7]
→ Merge: [0, 1, 3, 7]
