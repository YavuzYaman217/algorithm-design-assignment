Binary Search Algorithm
=======================

Description:
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half; otherwise, it continues in the upper half. This process repeats until the value is found or the interval is empty.

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Algorithm Steps:
1. Set low to 0 and high to n-1 (where n is array length)
2. While low <= high:
   - Calculate mid = low + (high - low) // 2
   - If key equals arr[mid], return 1 (found)
   - If key > arr[mid], search right half (low = mid + 1)
   - If key < arr[mid], search left half (high = mid - 1)
3. If loop ends, return -1 (not found)
