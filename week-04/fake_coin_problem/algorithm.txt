Fake Coin Problem Algorithm
============================

Description:
The fake coin problem involves finding a lighter (fake) coin among a collection of identical coins using a balance scale. In this implementation, coins are represented as an array where genuine coins have weight 1 and the fake coin has weight 0. The algorithm divides the coins into three groups, compares the sums to identify which group contains the fake coin, then returns its index.

Time Complexity: O(n) for single weighing with sum comparison
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing groups

Algorithm Steps:
1. Divide the array into three groups of equal size (or nearly equal)
   - Group 1: arr[0 : n/3]
   - Group 2: arr[n/3 : 2n/3]
   - Group 3: arr[2n/3 : n]
2. Calculate sum of Group 1 and Group 2
3. Compare sums:
   - If sum1 < sum2: fake coin is in Group 1
   - If sum2 < sum1: fake coin is in Group 2
   - If sum1 == sum2: fake coin is in Group 3
4. Find the position of 0 (fake coin) in the identified group
5. Calculate and return the original index by adding the offset

Note: This approach uses weight comparison rather than a traditional balance scale.
